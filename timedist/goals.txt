1. Event-by-event, fit timing distribution with two gaussians (how good is it?)
2. Save in TTree with starting position, starting direction, starting time (anything else?)
3. Look at it.
   A. Is distribution fairly consistent?
   B. Can I understand/model distribution in a simple way?
      i. Like: first peak->distance to AV,
               second peak->distance to AV, reflected to PSUP
                            width corresponds to angle of approach to PSUP
